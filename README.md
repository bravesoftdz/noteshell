# Instalation
You will need Lazarus  
http://www.lazarus-ide.org/  
to (once only) compile  
program for your operating system.  
It's very easy, just open noteshell.lpr via Lazarus  
File/Open and hit on (via Menu Run/Run) or  
directly green triangle icon.  
After that you can use only your executable.
Since Lazarus is available for all platforms  
Linux, OSX and Windows, noteshell is available   
for all of them.  
  
# shortcuts:  
Ctrl+S   Save  
Ctrl+M Minimize to tray   or you can click on tray icon   
Ctrl+L Show/Hide line numbers  
Ctrl+O Collapse all nodes  
Ctrl+E Expand all nodes  
  
For search in all files on linux  
grep -rin "some text" /pathtofolder/*.txt  

Hint: When entering part of node name in  
speedy ComboBox (5.th element on top) if it is  
autocompleted just hit on tab key.

You can rearrange nodes with drag-drop.  
For node names use only latin letters, numbers and _  
Of course you can use utf8 inside your notes.  
  
You can change directory path to notes files in   
second line of noteshell_settings file  
  
example for Linux and OSX  
/home/username/abcd/  
  
example for Windows  
D:\noteshell_files\  
  
000noteshelltreestate.txt and 000noteshelltree.txt   
are important files for keeping node structure so  
do not touch "careless" them manually.
